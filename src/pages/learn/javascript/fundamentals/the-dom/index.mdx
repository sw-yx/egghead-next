## “The DOM.”

It seems to appear everywhere the moment you begin looking for resources about JavaScript or React. Everyone seems to be quick to whip out the acronym and talk about it, but no one seems to have a simple explanation for what it is.

So, what exactly is the DOM? And why is it important for JavaScript?

## What the DOM is and isn’t

First, let’s make lists of what the DOM is, and isn’t.

- The DOM is an acronym for “Document Object Model.”
- The DOM is a “tree.”
- The DOM shows relationships between elements, referred to as parents, children, and siblings.
- The DOM is a type of API (Application Programming Interface).
- The DOM is not the source HTML, or the code you write.

As a matter of fact, the DOM is not a programming language at all.
The DOM is not what you see in the browser or in your browser’s DevTools.
It is also not what you see in the Render Tree (though the DOM Tree is an ingredient in generating a Render Tree).

If you’re furrowing your brows right now, don’t worry. We’re going to go over this and much more in this article!

## So, what is “the DOM,” really?

The DOM is an API that helps developers interact with “document nodes” within the browser. Your web browsers use the DOM Tree to determine how to display web pages.

You can think of the DOM as the “final output” of your browser after reading your code.

The DOM can interact with different web page documents like HTML, SVG, and XML. However, we will be focusing on just the HTML in this article.

## The DOM Node Tree

There are a lot of words and technical jargon that we can print onto this page to explain the DOM and what it does, but I think the best way to introduce it is by showing you what it “looks like.”

The visual representation of the DOM looks like a “tree” of “nodes.” However, you won’t ever see the “tree” in actuality. I know. I seem to be talking in circles, don’t I?

Let’s just get right down to it, and show you an actual DOM Node Tree (or DOM Tree, as it’s commonly referred to).

To the left is the code for a simple HTML web page. To the right is the graphical representation of the HTML code as nodes in a DOM Node Tree. Each element in the HTML like the Paragraph, Link, and Link Text are represented by “nodes.”

The nodes have relationships with other nodes, and can have “parents,” “children,” and “siblings.” You can think of these as you would with any family tree. “Children” of the same “Parent” are “Siblings.”
